The glad generated code itself is any of Public Domain, WTFPL or CC0, the source files for the generated code are under various licenses from Khronos.

EGL: See egl.xml
GL: Apache Version 2.0
GLX: Apache Version 2.0
WGL: Apache Version 2.0
Vulkan: Apache Version 2.0 with exceptions for generated code
Now the Apache License may apply to the generated code (not a lawyer), but see this clarifying comment.

Glad also adds header files form Khronos, these have separated licenses in their header.
